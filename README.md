Each folder contains focused explanations on specific topics. Start with the basics and progress to more advanced concepts:

1. **Linux** - Get comfortable with the command line first
2. **C++** or **Python** - Choose your primary language (or learn both!)
3. **Docker** - Learn containerization basics
4. **ROS2** - Dive into robot software development
5. **SLAM** - Understand mapping and localization
6. **Nav2** - Master autonomous navigation

## 🚀 Getting Started

Navigate to any folder and start with the `README.md` file inside. Each section builds upon fundamental concepts and progresses logically.

## 💡 Learning Tips

- Take your time with each concept
- Try examples in your own environment
- Don't skip the basics - they're crucial!
- Refer back to earlier sections when needed

## 📝 Note

This guide focuses on **concepts and understanding** rather than extensive code examples. The goal is to build solid foundational knowledge that you can apply in real projects.
